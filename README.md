## Brief description

During summer touristic marinas are full of amateur sailors that reserved a docking spot for spending the night. Since in many cases these people don't know well the place, reaching the correct docking spot in the marina can be stressful and dangerous given the big traffic. The IoT system that we propose uses an automatic boat identification method and some LCD screens to generate easily readable specific signage for each boat entering the marina.

The web interface for using this service can be found [here](https://lodauria.github.io/IoT_Group_Project), unfortunately the web page actions are not operational at the moment since the AWS license expired.

## Previous deliveries

### First delivery

The project status after the first delivery can be found [here](https://github.com/kernel-machine/IoTGroupProject/tree/first_assignment), while the required videos are linked below:

- [Product presentation](https://youtu.be/xBoODjK8p_Q)
- [Technical details](https://youtu.be/w8znmP87peo)
- [Performance evaluation](https://youtu.be/zOJKtFecgoM)

The concept idea of the first delivery has received bad feedback, so for the second delivery we have started from scratch with a new project idea.

Here we report the links to the videos required for the first dellivery, but relative to the new project idea:
